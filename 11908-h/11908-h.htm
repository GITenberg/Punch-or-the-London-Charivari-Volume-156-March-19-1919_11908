<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>President WILSON is stated to have played several keen games of
"shuffle-board" on the <i>George Washington</i>. As it is an open
secret that Lord ROBERT CECIL has been polishing up his
"shove-halfpenny" in the billiard-room of the Hotel Majestic
interesting developments are anticipated.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Primroses, daisies and wallflowers are in full bloom in many
parts of the country and young lambs may now be seen frisking in
the meadows. Can the POET LAUREATE be waiting for someone to get
sun-stroke?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The Commission on the Responsibilities and Crimes of the War
have not yet decided that the ex-Kaiser is guilty. At the same time
it is said that they have an idea that he knew something about
it.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>At a Belfast football match last week the winning team, the
police and the referee were mobbed by the partisans of the losing
side. Local sportsmen condemn the attack on the winning team as a
dangerous innovation.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The L.C.C. is training munition girls to be cooks. We understand
that the velocity and range will be clearly stamped on the bottom
of all pork-pies.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Stromness fisherman, on opening a halibut, found a large
cormorant in its stomach. Cormorants, of course, are not fastidious
birds. They don't mind where they nest.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The eclipse of the sun on May 28th should be a great success, if
we may judge by the immense time it has taken over rehearsals.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Inspector J.G. OGHAM, chief of the Portsmouth Fire Brigade, who
is about to retire, has attended over two thousand fires. Indeed it
is said that most of the local fires know him by sight.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Ghost stories," says a contemporary, "are being spread about
vacant houses in Dublin to decrease the demand for them." The old
caretaker's trick of training a couple of cockroaches to jump out
at the house-hunter is quite useless to-day.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Hull merchants complain that only one train leaves Hull per day
on which wet fish can travel. The idea of bringing the fish to
Billingsgate under their own steam has already been ventilated.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Found insensible with a bottle of sherry in his pocket, an East
Ham labourer was fined ten shillings for being drunk. It is
believed that had he been carrying the sherry anywhere else nothing
could have saved him.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>An absconding Trade Society treasurer last week hit upon a novel
idea. He ran away with his own wife.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Is nothing going to be done to stop the incursion of the sea at
Walton-on-the-Naze?" asks a contemporary. Have they tried the
effect of placing notice-boards along the front?</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>For the first time the public have been admitted to a meeting of
the Beckenham Council. It is pleasant to find that the importance
of good wholesome entertainment is not being lost sight of in some
places.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Asked by the Wood Green magistrates for the names of his six
children, a defendant said that he did not know them. It is a good
plan for a man to get his wife to introduce him to the
children.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It appears that a certain gentleman has managed to overcome the
domestic servant problem. He has married one.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A Salford man giving evidence in a local court told the
magistrates that his wife had repeatedly stuck pins into him. There
is no excuse for such conduct, even with pin-cushions at their
present inflated price.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>No one seemed to take the rat-plague very seriously in the Isle
of Wight until last week, when several rodents were discovered at
the Seaplane Station at Bembridge busily engaged in trying on the
pilots' flying coats.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>It is only fair to remark that, although the Government has
recently been found guilty of profiteering, they have never during
the War raised the price: of their ten-shilling notes.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Much difficulty is being experienced by the Allies in deciding
what. to do with the German Fleet. Curiously enough this is the
very dilemma that the Germans were faced with during most of the
War.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>We hear that the officials at Lincoln prison are much impressed
by the cleverness of DE VALERA'S escape and are anxious to present
him with an illuminated address, but unfortunately they do not know
it at present.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>A scientific organ points out that in deciding the fate of
Heligoland it should not be forgotten that it was once a valuable
ornithological observation station. The almost extinct <i>Pavo
Potsdamicus,</i> if we remember correctly, was an occasional
visitor to the island.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Congress, says a Washington message, is anxious to get back to
domestic business. It does not say whose.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>
<p>Yesterday morning, a freckled child, dripping oil and
perspiration and clad in a sort of canvas dressing-gown, stumbled
into "Remounts" (or "Demounts," as we should more properly call
ourselves nowadays) and presented me with a slip of paper which
entitled him, the bearer, to immediate demobilisation on pivotal
grounds. I handed it back to him, explaining that he had come to
the wrong shop&mdash;unless he were a horse, of course. If he were
and could provide his own nosebag, head-stall and Army Form 1640,
testifying that he was guiltless of mange, ophthalmia or epizootic
lymphangitis, I would do what I could for him.</p>
<p>He stared at me for a moment, then at the slip, then, murmuring
something about the mistake being his, began to feel in the
numerous pouches of his dressing-gown, bringing to light the
following items:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) A. spanner.</p>
<p>(2) Some attenuated cigarettes.</p>
<p>(3) A picture-postcard fashioned in silk, with tropical birds
and flowers, clasped hands, crossed Union Jacks and the legend
"TRUE LOVE" embroidered thereon.</p>
<p>(4) A handful of cotton waste.</p>
<p>(5) Some brandy-balls.</p>
<p>(6) An oil-can.</p>
<p>(7) The ace of spades.</p>
<p>(8) The portrait (tin-type) of a lady, inscribed "With kind
regards from Lizzie."</p>
<p>(9) A stick of chewing gum.</p>
<p>(10) A mouse (defunct).</p>
<p>(11) A second slip of paper.</p>
<p>He grunted with satisfaction, replaced his treasures carefully
in the pouches and handed the last-named item to me. It read to the
effect that both he and his car were at my disposal for the day. I
wriggled into a coat and followed him out to where his chariot
awaited us.</p>
<p>I never pretended to be a judge of motor vehicles, but it does
not need an expert to detect a Drift when he sees one; they have a
leggy, herring-gutted appearance all their own. Where it was not
dented in it bulged out; most of those little knick-knacks that
really nice cars have were missing, and its complexion had peeled
off in erratic designs such as Royal Academicians used to smear on
transports to make U-Boaters imagine they were seeing things they
shouldn't and lead better lives.</p>
<p>I did not like the looks of the thing from the first, and my
early impressions did not improve when, as we bumped off the drive
on to the <i>pav&eacute;</i>, the screen suddenly detached itself
from its perch and flopped into our laps.</p>
<p>However, the car put in some fast work between our ch&acirc;teau
gates and the <i>estaminet</i> of the "Rising Sun" (a distance of
fully two hundred yards), and my hopes soared several points. From
the <i>estaminet</i> of the "Rising Sun" to the village of
Bailleul-aux-Hondains the road wriggles down-hill in two sharp
hair-pin bends. The car flung itself over the edge of the hill and
plunged headlong for the first of these.</p>
<p>"Put on the brakes!" I shouted.</p>
<p>The child did some kicking and hauling with his feet and hands
which made no impression whatever on the car.</p>
<p>"Put on the brakes, damme!" I yelled.</p>
<p>The child rolled the whites of his eyes towards me and announced
briefly, "Brake's broke."</p>
<p>I looked about for a soft place to jump. There was none; only
rock-plated highway whizzing past.</p>
<p>We took the first bend with the nearside wheels in the gutter,
the off-side wheels on the bank, the car tilted at an angle of
forty-five degrees. The second bend we navigated at an angle of
sixty degrees, the off-side wheels on the bank, the near-side
wheels pawing thin air.</p>
<p>Had there been another bend we should have accomplished it
upside down. Fortunately there were no more; but there remained the
village street. We pounced on it like a tiger upon its prey.</p>
<p>"Blow your horn!" I screamed to the child.</p>
<p>"Bulb's bust," said he shortly, and exhibited the instrument,
its squeeze missing.</p>
<p>I have one accomplishment&mdash;only one&mdash;acquired at the
tender age of eleven at the price of relentless practice and a
half-share in a ferret. I can whistle on my fingers. Sweeping into
that unsuspecting hamlet I remembered this lone accomplishment of
mine, plunged two fingers into my cheeks and emptied my chest
through them.</p>
<p>"Honk, honk," blasted something in my ear and, glancing round, I
saw that the child had swallowed the bulbless end of his horn and
was using it bugle-wise.</p>
<p>Thus, shrilling and honking, we swooped through
Bailleul-aux-Hondains, zig-zagging from kerb to kerb. A speckly
cock and his platoon of hens were out in midstream,
souvenir-hunting. We took them in the rear before they had time to
deploy and sent a cloud of fluff-<i>fricass&eacute;e</i> sky-high.
A Tommy was passing the time o' day with the Hebe of the Hotel des
Trois Enfants, his mules contentedly browsing the straw
frost-packing off the town water supply. The off-donkey felt the
hot breath of the car on his hocks and gained the
<i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> (<i>vi&acirc;</i> the window) in one
bound, taking master and mate along with him.</p>
<p>The great-great-granddam of the hamlet was tottering across to
the undertakers to have her coffin tried on, when my frantic
whistling and the bray of the bugle-horn pierced the deafness of a
century. With a loud creaking of hinges she turned her head, summed
up the situation at a glance and, casting off half-a-dozen decades
"like raiment laid apart," sprang for the side-walk with the
agility of an infant gazelle. We missed her by half-an-inch and she
had nobody but herself to thank.</p>
<p>Against a short incline, just beyond the stricken village, the
car came to a standstill of its own accord, panting brokenly,
quivering in every limb.</p>
<p>"She's red-'ot," said the child, and I believed him.</p>
<p>From the kettle arrangement in the bows came the sound of hot
water singing merrily, while from the spout steam issued hissing.
The tin trunk, in which lurks the clockwork, emitted dense volumes
of petrol-perfumed smoke from every chink. The child climbed across
me and, dropping overboard, opened the lid and crawled inside. I
lit a pipe and perused the current "<i>La Vie Parisienne</i>."</p>
<p>The clockwork roared and raged and exploded with the sharp
detonations of a machine-gun. Sounds of violent coughing and
tinkering came from the bowels of the trunk, telling that the child
was still alive and busy. Presently he emerged to breathe and wipe
the oil off his nose.</p>
<p>"Cylinder missin'," he announced.</p>
<p>I was not in the least surprised. "Probably dropped off round
that last bend," said I. "Very nearly did myself. How many have we
got left?"</p>
<p>He gaped, muttered something incoherent and plunged back into
the trunk. The noise of coughing and tinkering redoubled. The smoke
enveloped us in an evil-smelling fog.</p>
<p>"Think she'll go now," said the child, emerging once more. He
climbed back over me, grasped the helm and jerked a lever. The car
gave a dreadful shudder, but there was no other movement.</p>
<p>"What's the matter now?" I asked after he had made another trip
to the bows.</p>
<p>He informed me that the car had moulted its winding handle.</p>
<p>"You'll 'ave ter push 'er till the engine starts, Sir," said
he.</p>
<p>"Oh, will I? And what will you be <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span> doing, pray?" I
inquired. He replied that he was proposing to sit inside and watch
events, steer, work the clutch, and so on.</p>
<p>"That sounds very jolly," said I. "All right; hop up and hold
your hat on." I went round to the stern, set my back against it and
hove&mdash;there seemed nothing else for it. Five hundred yards
further on I stopped heaving and interviewed the passenger. He was
very hopeful. The engine had given a few reassuring coughs, he
said, and presently would resume business, he felt convinced. Just
a few more heaves, please.</p>
<p>I doffed my British warm and returned to the job. A quarter of
an hour later we had another talk. All was well. The engine had
suffered a regular spasm of coughing and one back-fire, so the
child informed me. In half a jiffy we should be off.</p>
<p>I shed my collar, tie and tunic and bent again to the task. At
Notre Dame de la Belle Esp&eacute;rance we parleyed once more. He
was most enthusiastic. Said a few kind words about the good work I
was doing round at the back and thought everything was going
perfectly splendidly. The car's cough was developing every minute
and there had been two back-fires. All the omens were propitious. A
couple of short sharp shoves would do it. Courage, brave heart!</p>
<p>I reduced my attire to boots and underclothing, and toiled
through Belle Esp&eacute;rance, the curs of the village nibbling my
calves, the children shrilling to their mammas to come and see the
strong man from the circus.</p>
<p>At Quatre Vents the brave heart broke.</p>
<p>"Look here," said I to the protesting child, "if you imagine I'm
going to push you all the way to Arras you're 'straying in the
realms of fancy,' as the poet says. Because I'm not. Just you hop
out and do your bit, me lad. It's my turn to ride."</p>
<p>In vain did he argue that I was not schooled in the mysteries of
either steering or clutching. Assuring him that I precious soon
would be, I dragged him from his perch and took station at the
helm. Sulkily he betook himself to the stern of the vehicle, and
presently it began to move. Slowly at first, then faster and
faster. I suddenly perceived the reason of this. We were going
down-hill again, a steep hill at that, with wicked hair-pin bends
in it.</p>
<p>The engine began to cough, the cough became chronic, developing
into a galloping consumption.</p>
<p>"Brakes!" thought I (forgetting they were out of action), and
wrenched at a handle which was offering itself. The car jumped off
the mark like a hunter at a hurdle, jumped clear away from the
child (who sat down abruptly on the <i>pav&eacute;</i>) and bolted
down-hill all out. I glimpsed the low parapet of the bend rushing
towards me, an absurdly inadequate parapet, with the silvery gleam
of much cold water beyond it.</p>
<p>I have not preserved my life (often at infinite risk) through
four and a-half years of high-pressure warfare to be mauled to
death by a tin car at the finish. Not I. I got out. As I trundled
into the gutter I saw the car take the parapet in its stride,
describe a graceful curve in the blue, and plunge downwards out of
sight. The child and I reached the parapet together and peered
over. Seventy feet below us the waters of the river spouted for a
moment as with the force of some violent submarine explosion and
then subsided. A patch of oil came floating to the surface,
accompanied by my breeches and British warm.</p>
<p>The child looked at me, his eyes goggling with horror. "They
won't 'alf fry my liver for this, they won't, not 'alf," he gasped
huskily.</p>
<p>I laid a kindly hand upon his shoulder. "Not they, my lad; I'll
see to that. Listen. You have that slip entitling you to immediate
demobilisation?" He nodded, wondering. "Then demobilise yourself
<i>now</i>, at once, instantly!" I cried. "Run like blazes to
Calais, Boulogne, Havre, Marseilles&mdash;anywhere you like; only
run, you little devil, run!"</p>
<p>"But you, Sir?" he stuttered.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry about me," I smiled; "I shall be <i>quite</i>
all right. I'm going to lay all the blame on you."</p>
<p>He shot one scared glance, at me, then, picking up the skirts of
his dressing-gown, scampered off down the road as fast as his
ammunition boots would let him, never looking back.</p>

<h3>THE SCANDAL.</h3>
<i>Tramp (just discharged from workhouse</i>). "AND TO THINK THAT'S
WHAT WE PAYS RATES FOR!"</div>
<hr />
<h2>ON THE RHINE.</h2>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>There is an expression here which I expect will shortly become
as familiar as "Na poo," and that is, "Hoot up!" When I first beard
our mild and gently-mannered Carfax employ it as a vigorous word of
command to a civilian in this small German village, I thought he
had gone a little mad. For no good military purpose, it seemed to
me, could possibly be served by demanding an imitation of an owl at
eleven o'clock on a wintry morning. It argued a perverted sense of
humour at least; and in truth I had been expecting a slight lapse
from the paths of sanity on the part of our Mr. Carfax for some
time. For, you see, he is a pivotal man who cannot get away until
others arrive to replace the pivots, and it is difficult to
persuade him that all is for the best. But he informed me that
"Hoot up" had nothing whatever to do with, the night-cries of owls
or any other kind of bird, but was in fact the idiotic way in which
the natives of this country pronounce "<i>Hut ab</i>" (Hat
off).</p>
<p><i>Now</i> you realise what horrid Huns we are. Civilians are
obliged to take off their hats to British officers&mdash;a very
grim business. In reality, except that we are the hated English, it
makes very little difference to the Bosch, for the innkeeper here
says that orders concerning the taking off of hats to all and
sundry became so stringent in 1918 that the local postman was
constantly interrupted in his duties to answer the salutes of
people who wished to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Bosches who have really fought for their country do not object
to "Hoot-upping." They of course are the first to realise that
inhabitants of occupied countries were forced by them to "hoot up,"
and that therefore there is a certain justice now in the
retaliation. Anyway, from these people the procedure does not
greatly interest us; but the overdressed Bosch profiteer, fat and
muttony&mdash;to hoot him up in his own village! Really, you know,
in some ways the War has been worth while.</p>
<p>But the knowledge that he is carrying out a perfectly definite
order does not make the subaltern turn any the less pink the first
time he ticks off a civilian for failing to comply with the
regulations. No, you can't produce a really good Hun without lots
of practice. I made almost a companion of the Sergeant-Major at
first, because he used to say it for me; but the second day I got
caught. It came as I was picking my way down the main (and only)
street of the village. My attention being riveted upon keeping my
feet, for there are little streams on either side of the street
which freeze and flood it, making life in army boots difficult, I
did not notice the approach of the fellow until he was on me. And
then I saw it was a real Hunnish Hun; and, oh joy! he had a fur
coat and a face which I had not thought could exist outside bad
dreams. His wicked little eyes glared insolently at me, and he
strolled by with his hat stuck at a rakish angle; and for the life
of me, would you believe it? I could <i>not</i> remember the magic
words. Turning in desperation I commanded him without further delay
to "hot hoop." He appeared surprised. He made no sort of motion to
comply with my order. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id=
"page219"></a>[pg 219]</span> "Hut hop!" I cried, purple with
vexation, and still the abominable article of headgear remained
jauntily perched over his square ugly face. Advancing threateningly
I thundered out that it was my firm intention that he should, under
peril of instant arrest, "<i>take his confounded, hat off</i>!" At
this final command (the first he had found intelligible) he grabbed
hastily at the offending article, slipped up on the ice, and, in my
moment of triumph, so did I.</p>
<p>It is a sickening business sitting on the ground opposite a man
you don't like, but I had the better of it in the end, for I had
sat down where the water was already frozen, and he hadn't.</p>
<p>Our Mr. Carfax too had an awkward incident happen to him. We
were walking down the street discussing the Pay Warrant, which
gives the young Army of Occupation a bonus from February 1st, and
gives us nothing for doing their job until May, when suddenly a
civilian passed us with a mere nod. Mr. Carfax went on with his
insubordinate conversation, oblivious to the insult.</p>
<p>"Mr. Carfax," I said sadly, "when will you learn that private
affairs must never be allowed to interfere with military
duties?"</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, surprised and aggrieved, "though a pivotal man
of some years' standing I really am taking an interest in my
platoon&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is not that," I said; "but do you know you allowed a
civilian to pass on your side without taking his hat off?"</p>
<p>Scarlet with chagrin he rushed back after the offender and
"hooted him up" more sternly than I could have believed possible
for anybody but a Hun to the manner bred.</p>
<p>"I'm most awfully sorry," said the man, "but I've only just got
out and didn't know about it." It transpired (as they say) that he
was an Englishman who had been interned in the village for four
years.</p>

<h3><i>NOUVELLES DE PARIS</i>.</h3>
<p class="author"><i>Paris, March 1919.</i></p>
<p>DEAREST POPPY,&mdash;I have a piece of news to send you from
here that will give you a veritable <i>frisson d'angoisse</i>. No,
it doesn't concern the Peace Conference; it's something far worse
than that. <i>Figurez-vous</i>, the new style of <i>coiffure</i> is
severe to the point of being absolutely terrifying&mdash;that is to
the woman who has been shivering on the brink of thirty for any
length of time.</p>
<p>Foreheads are coming in again&mdash;<i>que c'est
emb&ecirc;tant</i>! I thought they'd been abolished long ago. I
wish I could get hold of the <i>m&eacute;chant</i> (for I know it's
a man) who is introducing them now. I had my hair dressed
<i>chez</i> Manet to-day in the new style, and when I saw myself
afterwards I sat down and wept like the women of Babylon.</p>
<p><i>Quel horreur!</i> My locks were strained, brushed, tightened
back, and I was left high and dry with my exposed brow revealing
four furrows to an unsympathetic world. <i>C'est navrant</i>. We're
not to be allowed even the <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of a wave or the
lightest <i>bouff&eacute;e</i>, while side-curls are quite
<i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;s</i>.</p>
<p>I think the situation is really tragic. So few women can afford
to have a forehead. The result will be that lots of our
<i>d&eacute;butantes</i> of some seasons ago will be
"<i>coiff&eacute;es &agrave; Ste. Catherine</i>" in more senses
than one.</p>
<p>The "jewellery" one wears now is made of wood; we have carved
wooden beads, wooden bracelets, even wooden rings. "Therefore it
will be cheap!" you exclaim. <i>Vous vous trompez, mon amie.</i> I
read a story the other day of an American who said that if you want
an egg here for breakfast it is cheaper to buy the hen and hope
she'll lay next morning, and in any case you've got the hen. <i>Eh
bien</i>, should you desire a set of wooden jewellery you might
save money if you bought a forest.</p>
<p>Paris has done more than extend <i>le bon accueil</i> to the
Peace delegates; she is giving their names to the latest thing in
<i>v&ecirc;tements</i>. Thus we have the Lloyd George
<i>cravate</i>, the Wilson <i>gilet</i> and the "Bonarlaw"
<i>chapeau melon</i>. It's surprising how far-reaching are the
effects of a Peace Conference.</p>
<p>A number of <i>nous autres Anglais</i> over here started a
perfectly <i>thrilling</i> idea. It was really in the way of being
an adventure. We have been exploring the quaint little
<i>caf&eacute;s</i> of Paris, with results <i>tout &agrave; fait
&eacute;tonnants</i>. We were served with provokingly delicious
<i>plats</i>, at a price absurdly moderate compared with what is
extorted from us in the hotels. Of course we were all enchanted. We
became <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of <i>caf&eacute;s</i> and ceased to
take any meals at our hotels beyond the matutinal <i>caf&eacute;
complet</i>.</p>
<p>And then, quite suddenly, a horrid newspaper article appeared
which conveyed suggestions <i>extr&ecirc;mement
d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables.</i> It insinuated, <i>ma
ch&egrave;re</i>, that "things are not what they seem"&mdash;at any
rate things in the bill of fare at the moderately-priced
eating-house.</p>
<p>It went on to speak of the many uses that domestic animals are
put to after their labours on earth are ended. If it was horse that
figured in the <i>boeuf bourguignon</i> served up to me, or the
<i>pot&eacute;e de boeuf aux choux</i> (of which I will admit I
<i>raffole</i>) I have no quarrel with it. It's the "<i>lapin</i>"
I have had occasionally that's giving me the most qualms. I can't
look at a cat now without a shudder.</p>
<p>As for Bertie, he says whenever he thinks of the <i>tripes
&agrave; la mode de Caen</i> he so often favoured, he's very glad
that he has even less imagination than his friends credit him
with.</p>
<p>Of course the article may have been inspired by the keepers of
hotels who were losing our custom. I think it's more than likely.
But we've decided for the present to give the hotels the benefit of
the doubt.</p>

<h3>DELYSIOUS DETAILS.</h3>
<p>A contemporary, hearing of the reported engagement of two
well-known persons in the world of Music and the Drama, interviewed
the lady and obtained from her the following synopsis of the
crucial moment:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I was lunching with my costumier this afternoon, and among the
people there was M&mdash;&mdash; After luncheon he asked me to be
his wife. I said 'Yes,' and the marriage takes place next week.
We've been friends since I was twelve years old, and his music is
the finest I have ever heard."</p>
<p>Spurred to emulation by this striking example of journalistic
enterprise, correspondents in all parts of the world are composing
piquant descriptions of similar contracts. We offer two
examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Miss Fanny V. Adie consented to give the correspondent of
<i>The Poppleton Observer</i> a few particulars of her engagement
to Captain Scorcher, O.B.E.:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I was sitting on my ambulance having a biscuit and tin of bully
with Alphonse (my French poodle), when suddenly there was a
terrific crash. It appears, as I learnt later, that Captain
Scorcher was motoring to Lille to purchase whisky and other medical
comforts, when the steering-gear of his 60-H.P. Rolls-Ford came
away in his hands, with the result that he nose-dived into the rear
of my ambulance at forty miles per hour. When I came to my senses
my head was in the ditch and the rest of me in mid-air. Captain
Scorcher, crawling out of the wreckage, said, 'Do you reverse?' and
then asked me to be his wife. I said 'Yes,' meaning I reversed, and
the marriage takes place as soon as we arrive at the same hospital.
We have been more or less bosom-friends for five minutes, and I
think his moustache is the sweetest thing I ever met."</p>
<p>2. Asked if she could confirm her reported engagement to Lord
Bertie Brasshatte, Miss Fifi Thistledowne&mdash;who dances "The
Camisole Squeeze" so daintily in "<i>Really, Girls!</i>" (the
Mausoleum revue)&mdash;recounted to the correspondent of <i>The
Jazzers' Gazette</i> the following romantic story:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I was having oysters and stout with my chiropodist at his place
in Stepney, and among the people there was Lord Bertie Brasshatte,
who is a martyr to cold feet, contracted during his visit to
Boulogne in 1918. (How can we ever repay these brave men for the
hardships they have suffered?) Well, after the tenth oyster he
passed me two slips of buff paper, pinned together. On the first
was written, 'For information and necessary action, please;' and on
the other, 'Are you engaged tomorrow?' I said, 'No,' and the
marriage takes place as soon as my agent can make arrangements with
the illustrated papers. We've been friends ever since Lord Bertie
left a lovely diamond tiara in my waste-paper basket, and I think
his suppers are the finest I have ever tasted."</p>
<hr />
<h3>HIMALAYANS AT PLAY.</h3>
<h4><i>(Suggested by the sequel to a recent Lecture.)</i></h4>
<p>The Chairman, Sir Norman Everest, after congratulating the
lecturer on his interesting address and beautiful photographs,
observed that he remained unconvinced by his arguments in favour of
approaching Mount Amaranth from the North. The climatic
difficulties of that route were in his opinion insuperable, to say
nothing of the hostility of the natives of the Ong-Kor plateau and
the Muzbakh valley. He still believed that the best mode of
approach was from the South-West, following the course of the
Sissoo river to Todikat, where an ample supply of yaks could be
obtained, and thence proceeding along the Dagyolong ridge to
Tumlong.</p>
<p>Sir Francis Oldmead said that he had seldom heard a more
interesting lecture or seen a finer collection of photographs. He
must be allowed to demur, however, to the lecturer's <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
description of the heavy snowfall in the highlands of Sandjakphu.
During his visit to that district, as they would see from the
photographs which he would presently show on the screen, he enjoyed
uninterrupted sunshine; nor had he met with the slightest
difficulty from the Pangolins of Phagdub. As for the best approach
to Mount Amaranth he was convinced that the only feasible route was
to work up the Yulmag valley to the Chikkim frontier at Lor-lumi,
crossing the Pildash at Gonglam, and, skirting the deep gorge of
the Spudgyal, ascend the Takpa glacier to Teshi Tsegpa.</p>
<p>Professor Parbatt expressed his keen appreciation of the vivid
descriptions of Himalayan scenery given by the lecturer, and the
admirably-selected photographs which had enlivened his address. He
wished, however, that he could have furnished more details as to
his camp equipment. Had he, for example, used Nummulitic beds for
his party? Then there was the question of geoidal deformation, on
which he had remained unaccountably silent. As for the vital
problem of approaching Mount Amaranth, he ventured to differ from
all the previous speakers. The Northern, South-Western and Eastern
routes were all equally impracticable, as he would conclusively
demonstrate from the photographs he had brought with him. But there
were at least fourteen routes from the West, of which he would
confine himself to four. (1) Starting from Yeh, the party might
cross the Tablung-La pass to Gorkpa Nor, and thence follow the
Yombo to Chilgat, where they would be only twenty-five miles from
the foot of the western face of Amaranth. (2) They could follow the
old Buriat pack-road to Amdo, diverge by the narrow defile of
Koko-Pir-Panjal to Tumbung, and thence make for Ghapchu-Srong and
Chyang-Chub-Gyultshan. (3) They might start from Pongrot and cross
the Tok-Tok pass to Pilgatse. (4) They might construct a tube from
Darjiling to Grogma-Nop, and thence proceed by aeroplane to the
saddle of Makalu, or, better still, to the summit of Amaranth
itself. The last route was far the shortest and quickest, but it
involved a certain amount of preliminary expense.</p>
<p>The Chairman having expressed his regret that Sir Marcon Tinway
was not present to describe his experiments with man-lifting kites
and trained albatrosses, the assembly dispersed after singing the
Tibetan national anthem.</p>

<h3>AN UNHAPPY HERO.</h3>
<p>Poor Clayton-Vane's case is one of the most poignant peace
tragedies that have come to my notice. He had just acquired an
inexplicable but genuine enthusiasm for stockbroking when the War
gave him the opportunity of developing into a remarkably brilliant
officer. Not only did he attain his majority, but gathered a
perfect chestful of decorations, including all the common varieties
and several which leave civilians guessing.</p>
<p>Yet strange to say the man who has won these honours in war
detests soldiering with all his heart. He fought as a duty, and did
his share with furious energy in the hope of so shortening the War.
His hatred of the military profession is indeed equalled only by
his love of stockbroking and by his natural pride in having
scrapped right on from the word "Go!" till November 10th, 1918,
when he was sent home slightly wounded.</p>
<p>Now the tragedy of which he is the pathetic central figure is
the result of his remarkably youthful appearance. Every time his
portrait figures in <i>The Daily Scratch</i>, people say, "Why, he
looks a mere child! But then these Press photographs always do
distort one so." Yet in this instance people are unjust.
Clayton-Vane, after a four years' flirtation with death, has the
face and figure of a careless chubby schoolboy. When he is in
uniform this youthfulness only adds lustre to his blushing
honours.</p>
<p>Now my unhappy friend is on the horns of a dilemma. He pines to
go back to broking as sincerely as some men pine to travel or to
write poetry, but every time he ventures out in mufti some painful
incident warns him what he will have to suffer as a civilian, with
his round rosy face, innocent blue eyes, curly hair and bright
smile. He hears himself referred to as a chip of the old block.
Chance acquaintances ask him if his father or big brothers were at
the Front. To-day, he told me very bitterly, he was asked if he did
not wish the War had lasted a little longer so that he might have
been old enough to go out and fight!</p>
<p>"I can't bear it, old man," he said. "There's something about me
that draws out their sentimentality, and they've all got to say
something about my youth, and the heritage of peace that the 1917
conscripts won for me. They talk as if I had been busy with a
feeding-bottle instead of compressing my silly face in a
box-respirator."</p>
<p>His dilemma is a very painful one for a man so sensitive and at
the same time so enamoured of stockbroking. Hard as the
renunciation will be, I really believe he will end by turning his
back on the Exchange for ever and taking a regular commission,
though I try to persuade him that if he will only brave the horrors
of peace as he braved the horrors of war he will win through in the
end and grow out of his face.</p>

entirely baseless.</p>
<p>Scots legal terminology always puzzles me. The "peremptory
diets" which Mr. MACQUISTEN urged upon the attention of the
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY as a remedy for the grievances of
Glasgow's financiers are not, as you might suppose, a synonym for
forcible feeding; nor have they anything to do with the substitutes
for "parritch" to which, as I gathered from Mr. STURROCK, the
people of Scotland are being obliged to resort owing to the high
price of oatmeal.</p>
<p>Members rubbed their eyes a little when they heard Colonel AMERY
declare that the general policy of the Government regarding
Imperial Preference had been "clearly defined" and in the ensuing
debate Sir DONALD MACLEAN declared that, on the contrary, their
whole fiscal policy was "wrop in mystery."</p>
<p>The veil was lifted to some extent by Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES, the
Ministerial "handy man," who, in the absence through illness of Sir
ALBERT STANLEY, explained how the Government proposed to regulate
imports and exports during the transitional period. Up to September
1st our manufacturers are to enjoy a sort of close-time, free from
foreign competition, but after that they must, like the partridges,
take their chance.</p>
<p>Later in the evening the House welcomed a new orator in Dr.
MURRAY, who sits for the Western Isles. He made a rousing appeal on
behalf of the men&mdash;practically the whole able-bodied
population&mdash;who had gone from them to fight the Empire's
battles. In his view the SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND was too mild in his
methods, and should be "bristling with thistles and flourishing the
claymore" when he tackled the reform of the Land Laws. Mr. MUNRO
was evidently flattered by this tribute to the martial
potentialities underlying his eminently pacific exterior.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, March 11th</i>.&mdash;In moving the Second Reading
of his Bill to enable women to become barristers and solicitors,
Lord BUCKMASTER thought it necessary to assure the House that there
was no danger of its flooding the Inns with prospective Bar-maids.
He might have spared his apologetics, for there was no opposition.
The LORD CHANCELLOR welcomed the Bill on behalf of the Government,
and expressed the conviction that the Benchers, though not "avid of
this change," would nevertheless loyally co-operate if Parliament
saw fit to adopt it.</p>
<p>Having caught the infection from the Commons the Peers then
proceeded to discuss their own procedure. From Lord CURZON we
learned, somewhat to our surprise, that the House possesses certain
Standing Orders. At present it honours them chiefly in the breach,
and in its Leader's view it would do well to imitate the more
orderly procedure of another place, even to the adoption of
"starred questions" and the abandonment of the practice by which
any noble Lord, by the simple process of addressing an inquiry to a
Minister, can initiate a full-dress debate. Lord CREWE'S pious hope
that these suggestions would enable more noble Lords to take part
in the debates was welcomed by Lord AMPTHILL, who remarked that,
after nearly thirty years in that House, he had never before been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg
226]</span> made aware of this desire for backbench orations.</p>
<p>As originally introduced the Rent Restriction Bill was strictly
limited in its operation. But landlord-baiting is a sport to which
the House of Commons is much addicted, and by the time the measure
emerges from Committee its own draughtsman will hardly recognise
it.</p>
<p>The best of the many Amendments complacently accepted, after a
show of reluctance, by the Government spokesmen, was one providing
that no increase of rent shall be chargeable except in the case of
a house "reasonably fit for habitation." That should make some of
our slum-owners sit up and take notice.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, March 12th</i>.&mdash;An apparently innocent
request from Lord SUDELEY for the reinstatement of the system of
guide-lecturers in the Museums led to quite a lively debate. Other
noble lords used the motion as a peg for a fierce indictment of the
Government's treatment of these institutions during the War. Lord
CRAWFORD, who has probably forgotten more about Art than some of
his critics ever knew, concealed his real sympathy for the motion
under a mask of official obstructiveness, but was compelled
eventually to give it a strictly provisional acceptance.</p>
<p>In the old days when the possession of a seat was secured by the
deposit of a hat it was no uncommon thing, on the morning of a big
debate, to see a Member staggering in under a load of toppers, with
which he proceeded to secure seats for his friends. To put an end
to this nefarious practice the card-system was introduced; but
that, it is said, has now been similarly abused. One man one card,
however, is in future to be the rule. Colonel WILL THORNE feared
that it might still be circumvented by the "stage army" trick; but
the SPEAKER thought the attendants might be trusted to recognise
and defeat any Member who essayed it.</p>
<p>Rear-Admiral Sir REGINALD HALL, having added to his laurels by
defeating a NELSON at Liverpool, took his seat this afternoon, and
was loudly cheered for the manner in which he came into action. He
and his supporters maintained their "line abreast" and discharged
their salvoes of salutes to the Chair with faultless precision.</p>
<p>Later on the gallant Admiral earned further cheers for a capital
maiden speech on the Naval Estimates. These were introduced by Mr.
LONG, who told the story of the Navy's triumph with all a
landsman's enthusiasm. Its future size may to a certain extent
depend upon the Judgment of Paris, but he was certain that, come
what may, the Nation would always insist on having a Fleet
sufficient for our needs&mdash;a sentiment which received the
welcome endorsement of Mr. BRACE for the Labour Party.</p>
<p>According to Commander NORMAN CRAIG it was anything but
sufficient for our needs when war broke out. It lacked docks,
destroyers, submarines, air-ships&mdash;everything, in fact, save
Dreadnoughts, which, in the absence of these accessories, had to
belie their name and rush from one unprotected anchorage to another
in fear of the German mosquito-craft. Only the courage of the
officers and men saved us, and up to the present&mdash;that was the
tenor of many of the speeches&mdash;they have reaped but a scanty
reward.</p>

<h4>GENERAL SEELY'S NON-STOP FLIGHT.</h4>
</div>
<p><i>Thursday, March 13th</i>.&mdash;Ministers left at home to
"mind the shop" would rather like, I fancy, to put up a notice over
the Palace of Westminster, "Closed till after the Peace
Conference." Nearly every problem presented to them depends for its
ultimate solution upon the decisions arrived at in Paris. Lord
STUART OF WORTLEY, for example, put a series of most pressing
questions regarding the present condition and future prospects of
Poland; but Lord CURZON in reply could only shrug his shoulders (at
considerable length) and refer him to the Conference.</p>
<p>The LEADER of the House of Commons labours under similar
disabilities, which are beginning to try even his amiable temper.
Until Paris has spoken he cannot give definite information about
the Government's fiscal policy, the amount of the German indemnity
and other pressing topics, and, as he told some of his persistent
questioners this afternoon, it is no good putting the same question
to him every week and expecting a different answer.</p>
<p>The best news of the day is that there will be an ample supply
of currants for Whitsuntide school-treats, and <i>Smith minor's</i>
translation of "<i>Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum</i>"
as "Not everyone is lucky enough to find a currant in his war-bun"
will no longer be applicable.</p>
<p>Five years ago General SEELY, then Secretary of State for War,
asked timidly for a single million for aircraft. To-day, as
Under-Secretary for Air, he boldly demanded sixty-six millions, and
explained that but for the Armistice the amount would have been two
hundred millions. And the House, after hearing his glowing account
of the wonderful achievements of our airmen, readily voted the
money. A good deal of it is to go, quite rightly, to relieving the
hardships of demobilisation, which fall with peculiar severity on
men whose special training is not much use to them in civil life.
The least we can do when they are forced to descend from their
chosen element is to insure them against a bad landing.</p>

<h3>THE BIBLE IN PAIN.</h3>
<p>MR. H.G. WELLS' new novel, based on the Book of Job, and Mr.

HOLOFERNES, by no means exhaust the Biblical and Apocryphal motives
from which our popular writers are now drawing inspiration.</p>
<p>Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD'S next novel will be a minutely analytical
study of the contrasted temperaments of ESAU and JACOB, the one
standing for revolt and the other for a rather smooth and supple
orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Mr. E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM is turning his attention to a new spy
romance woven about the experiences of CALEB and JOSHUA.</p>
<p>Professor CHALMERS MITCHELL has long been engaged on a monograph
on the Ark and its inmates, in which the famous zoologist will
explain the conditions under which the animals lived, the
segregation and food problems, and how the complexities following
disembarcation were dealt with by NOAH and his family. Lord PIRRIE
is contributing a chapter on the structure of the vessel, and there
will be an appendix on the dangers of overcrowding by Sir ARTHUR
NEWSHOLME.</p>
<p>Mr. GALSWORTHY has also been turning his attention to the Ark,
and the inhumane congestion of the creatures that were packed into
it. The result should be a very interesting psychological and
sociological work, the leading character being HAM'S wife, whom the
novelist figures as a protester to her father-in-law against his
treatment of all the animals, but in particular of the two Pekinese
spaniels.</p>
<p>Mr. ALEC WAUGH has nearly completed an indictment of private
tuition based on the story of SAMUEL and ELI.</p>
<p>Mr. H.B. IRVING, turning aside for the moment from the study of
more recent turpitude, is preparing an analytical memoir on the
first murder, that of ABEL by CAIN. With all his well-known
thoroughness he reconstructs the crime and shows in what
particulars CAIN, although an innovator, proved himself also an
adept.</p>
<p>Mr. GEORGE MOORE is meditating a revised version of the story of
JOSEPH and his Brethren, which in his opinion is sadly in need of
re-writing, suffering as it does from an unsophisticated simplicity
of diction and thought.</p>
<p>Mr. CONRAD is busy with a new romance treating of JONAH and the
whale, in which, for the sake of verisimilitude, JONAH will himself
recount his strange adventure to a few personal friends. As the
narrative runs to over a hundred thousand words the reader may be
sure that no detail of realism is omitted from the description of
the luckless voyage.</p>
<p>Mrs. ELINOR GLYN'S new novel will be called <i>The Heart of

<p>The movie-producers are not idle. After the greatest difficulty

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>
<h3>"THE HOUSE OF PERIL."</h3>
<p>The maker of a plot that turns upon murder and drugging in the
neighbourhood of a Continental gambling haunt must be aware that
his work is not going to be brought to the test of common
experience, and he is therefore less likely to be hampered by the
laws of probability. But there are limits even to the British
public's gift of credulity. How far Mrs. BELLOC LOWNDES may have
enjoyed special privileges in the search for her material I cannot
say; but for myself I confess that a modest acquaintance with the
atmosphere of European casinos has left me in absolute ignorance of
any such society as that of the hosts of The House of Peril.
Perhaps Mrs. LOWNDES'S book (which I have not read) may throw light
on this dark mystery; but in the play&mdash;and the play's the only
thing that concerns us here&mdash;I could trace nothing to indicate
to my poor intelligence how it was that two decently-bred ladies
and their escort, a perfectly honest French officer, ever came to
find themselves on terms of easy intercourse with the frowsy old
German couple who lived at the Chalet des Muguets, Lacville, on the
proceeds of robbery.</p>

<p>Any obstacle which these repellent Teutons may have had to
overcome in the ultimate execution of their nefarious designs must
have been the merest child's-play compared with the initial
difficulty of inducing the right kind of victim to penetrate so
fifth-rate an interior. One never even began to get over the
inherent improbability of such an attraction.</p>
<p>And I was the less disposed to take things for granted because
of the rather irritating obscurity that veiled the opening of the
Second Act, in which we are introduced to The House of Peril and
are left for a long time in doubt as to the nature of the place and
its relation to anything that has gone before. I think this must
have been the fault of the adapter, Mr. VACHELL. He seems to have
assumed in his audience a general knowledge of the original
story&mdash;dangerous confidence, even in the case of so clever and
popular a writer as Mrs. BELLOC LOWNDES.</p>
<p>It certainly was his fault that the end of the play was like
nothing ever seen off the stage. Let me briefly put the scene
before you. A young Englishwoman, paying a farewell call upon the
criminals of The House of Peril, has been drugged by them. She
wakes up prematurely to find them collecting her pearl
necklace&mdash;four thousand pounds' worth of it. Murder is in the
air, when suddenly, to the surprise of the villains (but not to
ours, for we had had fair warning of the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>),
enter to the rescue two admirers of the lady. In the excitement
attendant upon her recovery from a swoon the druggists are suffered
to pass out through the door into the arms of a posse of
constabulary.</p>
<p>At this juncture, the lady having been restored to her senses,
you might suppose that the rescue-party would take at least some
fleeting interest in the disposal of their prisoners. There you
would be in error. The final curtain is due and there are
peremptory affairs of the heart to be wound up before we can get
away. So, to clear the ground, one of the admirers makes a gallant
statement which redeems the other's character from a false
suspicion, and, rightly regarding himself as <i>de trop</i>, goes
off by another exit and shows no further concern in either of the
two developments&mdash;on or off the stage.</p>
<p>The remaining admirer, left alone in the company of the lady,
ignores with a fine detachment the impotent rage that his captives
are presumably venting in the passage just outside, and declares
the ardour of his passion as a man might do in the breathless calm
of a moonlit solitude <i>&agrave; deux</i>. And on this idyllic
scene the curtain descends.</p>

</div>
<p>The most satisfying thing in the play was the acting of Miss
ANNIE SCHLETTER as "<i>Madame" Wachner</i> of the Chalet des
Muguets, an extraordinarily clever study of the doting
<i>Hausfrau,</i> much busied about the service of her lord. Mr.
NORMAN MCKINNEL as <i>Wachner</i> easily contrived to convey the
typically Teuton blend of brutishness, and domestic sentimentality,
combined with the heavy playfulness which by a curious delusion,
ineradicably racial, is mistaken over there for humour. "Ja, ja,"
he says complacently, "I have the humour-sense."</p>
<p>It was regrettable that the cosmopolitan <i>Anna Wolsky,</i>
acted with great animation by Miss MARGARET HALSTAN, had to
withdraw from the scene at an early stage in consequence of being
murdered&mdash;I don't know how, as we neither saw nor heard the
details. Her friend, <i>Sylvia Bailey</i>, however, stayed on to
the finish, and Miss EMILY BROOKE saw her nicely through her
troubles. A very level performance.</p>
<p>To the rather wooden part of <i>William Chester</i> (foil to
hero) Mr. JOHN HOWELL brought a certain unliveliness <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg 229]</span> of his
own. A better chance was taken by Miss STELLA RHO, who gave proof
of a vivid personality in her brief sketch of a professional
fortune-teller who admitted to her clients (this must be very
unusual) that she nearly always made a mess of her
crystal-gazing.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. OWEN NARES, looking pretty and not too warlike in
the gay uniform of a French Officer of Cavalry, played the hero's
part with a very natural and fluent charm. I join in the general
hope that this, the first play under his actor-management, will go
well. It ought to, for though, in point of power to thrill, it did
not quite confirm the promise of its sinister name and theme it was
never for a moment dull, and its faults were the kind of
stage-faults about which, while they give the critic a chance of
being unkind, a British audience never worries too much.</p>

<h2>DAISY.</h2>
<p>He was always called Daisy. We hated the name, but the
christening "just happened" with the suddenness of influenza or an
earthquake. Percy was the culprit, for he knocked all our
pre-arranged plans for a name on the head by his passion for what
he calls "apt quotation." When he (Daisy) emerged from his basket
we saw that, like NELSON, he was blind of an eye. Percy,
immediately inspired, quoted from WORDSWORTH'S <i>Ode to the
Daisy</i>, "A little Cyclops with one eye"&mdash;and the result was
inevitable. Daisy resented the name from the first, for at the very
font, so to speak, he drew blood from us both, and then, utterly
indifferent to our feelings, settled himself on the top of an empty
beer barrel and there performed his evening ablutions.</p>
<p>It was a curious coincidence that made him select a beer barrel,
for thereby hung a tragic tale. He and his twin-brother had been
adopted from infancy by the Sergeants' Mess and had lived in peace
and plenty&mdash;in fact in too much plenty, for I regret to say
that Daisy's brother died of drink from having formed the
discreditable habit of emptying all the dregs of the Sergeants'
beer mugs into his own inside. However, he was granted military
obsequies, which were so successfully performed that an account of
them found its way into one of the daily papers. This so delighted
the amateur undertakers that Daisy's brother was at once exhumed
and re-buried with further pomp and circumstance. Daisy meanwhile,
feeling himself of less consequence than the departed hero, began
to mope; so to save life and reason he was sent to us "to cheer and
cherish," as the Sergeants put it.</p>
<p>An egotistical irascible bachelor seagull; yet his vices, and he
was made up of them, became virtues in our eyes.</p>
<p>The morning after his arrival he went for a solemn tour of
investigation, finally taking up his abode in the middle of the
tennis-court, as being to his mind the most salubrious
spot&mdash;and from there he ruled despotically. "That blooming
bird fears neither man nor devil," Cook was heard to mutter, after
he had embedded his beak in her ankle; and it was quite true. He so
terrified Horatio, our portly bull-dog, by pecking at his sensitive
kinky tail from behind when he was absent-mindedly lapping water
from Daisy's bath, that he never again ventured alone on to the
lawn. I say "alone," for he dared once more, emboldened by the
presence of his unwilling young wife, who accompanied him, tied by
a rope to his collar.</p>
<p>Percy and I watched them advance from afar and waited in
suspense for the sequel. Daisy was taking a post-prandial nap
inside his beer barrel. There was a breathless hush, followed by a
pandemonium of sound, masculine and feminine cries of distress
mingled with raucous shrieks of anger, and then we saw our valiant
couple in slow but ignominious retreat. Horatio was dragging his
spouse along on her back, with legs in air and bulging eyes! What
had happened in the interim we never knew, but both Mr. and Mrs.
Horatio bore marks of battle, and they were sadder and wiser dogs
for many days to come.</p>
<p>Percy, always deprecatingly anxious to find favour in Daisy's
eyes, tore down to the shore one morning before breakfast and
returned with a large pailful of salt water, which he laid&mdash;so
to speak&mdash;at Daisy's feet. Daisy glanced at it and at Percy
with his cold grey eye, and then stepped lightly into his
fresh-water tub, which was always at hand. Percy however, being of
an unsnubbable disposition, tried again to find a way into Daisy's
heart, and this time he brought Hengist and Horsa, two young
seagulls that he had found derelict on the rocks, hoping that he
would take a paternal interest in their loneliness; but, like his
great prototype, Daisy clapped his glass to his sightless eye, and
"I'm damned if I see them," he said. But he saw them all right at
meal times, when he would whisk round suddenly as their portion of
fish was flung to them, and swiftly gobble it up!</p>
<p>So Daisy prospered and grew sleek and fat, and his days were
long in the land. He consented indeed to partake of our hospitality
for over a year, won many hearts, but kept his own intact, until
the following spring, when a young man's fancy lightly turns to
thoughts of love; then be preened his white waistcoat and sallied
forth.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Did I say he was a bachelor? The last we beard of him was from a
fisherman friend who, when in search of sea-birds' eggs, saw and
recognised our Daisy by the fierceness of his one eye. He was
reluctantly taking his turn on the family egg while Mrs. Daisy
stretched and titivated herself after her domestic labours.</p>
<p>Does he sometimes, we wonder, think regretfully of his celibate
days and the beer barrel, where he lived <i>en
gar&ccedil;on?</i></p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<h4><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)</i></h4>
<p>MR. H.M. HYNDMAN brings to <i>Clemenceau: the Man and his
Time</i> (GRANT RICHARDS) a specialised knowledge of the
intricacies of French politics, personal friendship with his
subject and a sympathy not discounted by profound differences of
opinion. Here is one veteran fighting man writing a brilliant (I
don't use the word as a <i>clich&eacute;</i>) chronicle and
commentary of the battles of another, battles which cover the same
period and were fought broadly for the same causes. But the French
Radical extremist could never see his way to subscribe to the
Socialist creed. His stalwart individualism, in part temperamental,
was also as a political working faith the result of a distrust of
logic divorced from the experience and responsibility of actual
administration. Somewhat similarly the English Socialist refused to
let logic press him into the premature Internationalism of so many
of his associates, nor did he share their trust, so ruthlessly
betrayed, in German Social Democracy as having either the power or
the serious intention of thwarting German Imperialism. If a man's
achievement be rightly gauged by the difficulties he has overcome,
then M. CLEMENCEAU, called unwillingly and unwilling at the most
desperate crisis of the destiny of a distracted and dispirited
France hammered by the enemy's legions and with the pass ready for
sale by false friends, may well justify Mr. HYNDMAN'S verdict on
him as <i>the</i> statesman of the Great War. The man who came into
the War a mere Tiger will go out of it an authentic Lion.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>"Miss BERTA RUCK" is among the few writers from whom I can
really enjoy stories about the War. She has an engaging way with
her that can turn even that (at least the more endurable aspects of
it) to favour and prettiness. And in <i>The Land Girl's Love
Story</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), a theme after her own heart, she
has given us what is, I think, her best achievement so far. It is
an excellent slight tale of two heroines who took their patriotic
turn at the work of the land army on a Welsh farm, and the
adventures, agricultural and (of course) amorous, that befell them
there. It is all the best-humoured affair imaginable, refreshingly
full of country airs and brisked up with a fine flavour of romance.
"Miss RUCK" has the neatest hand for this kind of thing; she
permits no loose ends to the series of love-knots that she ties so
amusingly. So the finish of the comedy deserves the epithet
"engaging" in more senses than one: with a Jack to every Jill, and
the harvest moon (as promised in the cover picture) beaming upon
all, the couples paired off to everyone's entire satisfaction. A
tale that will be safe for a <i>succ&egrave;s fou</i> with all who
have worn the smock and the green armlet; while I can well imagine
that ladies less fortunate may find their enjoyment of it tempered
with a certain wistfulness.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg
232]</span><p><i>German Days</i> (MURRAY) is a plain tale of everyday
life in Germany before the War, with just those gaps in it which
would naturally occur in the narrative of any one observer who also
hadn't been aware at the time that she was observing. "A POLISH
GIRL (C.B.)" has written this account with an engaging frankness
and an apparent lack of exaggeration which distinguish it among
books of its kind. It is largely a record of school days, and
"C.B.," as the child of a Polish Jew of good standing living in
Posen, suffered slights and insults and met with injustices which a
"true German" would not have had to endure; but she does not seem
embittered. Her picture of the German at home has not made me yearn
to renew my acquaintance with him, but it seems to explain the
origin of some of his most unpleasant qualities. Since, as "C.B."
and other writers would have us know, the German soldier was cowed
by physical suffering in peace-time it is small matter for wonder
that he became a brute in war, or that the citizen, to whom
everything used to be <i>verboten</i>, has, since the bureaucracy
which regulated his smallest actions went to pieces, shown very
little ability to regulate them for himself. The terrible pact, by
which in the ten years preceding the War thousands of German women
bound themselves to combat the predominance of the landed classes,
which was making life for ordinary people a slow starvation, is one
of the things which I am induced to believe, because "C.B." has
dealt so faithfully with others of which I knew already. Of books
on Germany from within there have been very many, but there is
still room for such books as this.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>You must not be shocked to find that Captain HARRY GRAHAM has
(apparently) abandoned the lighter fields of literature for the
heavy plough-land of Biography. What is, I believe, his initial
venture of this kind lies before me in <i>Biffin and His Circle</i>
(MILLS AND BOON), a record of the career of <i>Reginald Drake
Biffin</i>, that eminent author with whose works (<i>The Bolster
Book</i>, and others) the public is already familiar; though, by a
pardonable confusion, they are more usually associated with the
name of the present biographer. It may be said at once that, if a
life of <i>Biffin</i> had to be written, Captain GRAHAM was
emphatically the man for the task; indeed, from the preface, with
its absorbing account of the inception of the work in certain
alleged convivialities between author and publishers, to the final
chapter, there is not a page that is not calculated to inspire the
reader with profound (and in my own case frequently uncontrollable)
emotion. Nor is the work valuable for the central figure alone. Of
each member of the <i>Biffin</i> circle Captain GRAHAM tells (nay,
repeats) some anecdote that forms a tribute at once to the
fertility of his research and the industry of his invention. I
should not omit to add that the volume is enriched with some
admirably reproduced portraits of members of the <i>Biffin</i>
circle, as also by an index that is itself a monument of inaccuracy
so subtle that it must be traced to be appreciated.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>Mr. REGINALD BLUNT has scored another brilliant success with
<i>The Wonderful Village</i> (MILLS AND BOON). It is one of his
Chelsea books of anecdote, gossip and good talk of which he
possesses the secret. He knows how to create the right Chelsea
atmosphere and he is most artful in leading his readers on, just as
a little dog shows himself every now and then at a decoy and thus
draws the inquisitive ducks after him till they drift in with all
exit cut off. At one moment Mr. BLUNT gives you a glimpse of that
bloodthirsty butcher, KING HENRY VIII. Then you pass to ANNE
BOLEYN, CATHERINE PARR and the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. Further on there
is a delightfully humorous account by WILLIAM DE MORGAN of his
attempt to induce CARLYLE to become a member of the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Buildings: "He promised to think it over,
chiefly, I think, because Sir JAMES STEPHEN had rather implied that
the Society's object was not worth thinking over. He added one or
two severe comments on the contents of space." The various Chelsea
potteries are not omitted, and there is an account of the wonderful
set designed and executed by the WEDGWOODS for the EMPRESS
CATHERINE OF RUSSIA. Of this, in 1909, about one thousand pieces
were surviving. Who shall say where those are now? I may add that
the author's profits on this book are to be given for the
assistance of our blinded soldiers and sailors at St.
Dunstan's.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>The title of Miss F.E. MILLS YOUNG'S <i>The Shadow of the
Past</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON) does not refer to the youthful
transgressions of any of her characters, but to the cloud which the
Boer War left behind it, to burst ultimately in rebellion. I do not
know any novelist who brings to her work a greater sympathy with or
a finer feeling for South Africa than Miss YOUNG, and if her
moderate methods do not find favour the reason can only be that for
the moment moderation is a rather unpopular quality. As regards the
actual story given to us here I find myself unable to accept the
hero, <i>Guy Matheson</i>, with any great enthusiasm. Fresh from
the kissing of one girl, he at once falls heavily in love with
another. Number One, however, secured him in the end, for he
discovered that his feeling for her was real affection, while
passion had been responsible for his affair with Number Two. But I
fancy that he would still need a little watching. Intermingled with
his love affairs is a tale of racial prejudice and intrigue which
is told with restraint and skill. <i>Holman</i>, a German agent who
had dropped an "n" for his better security, is an obnoxious person,
in whose underhand work I can quite readily believe.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
